SonicCrypt â€“ SSTV Encryption Tool
SonicCrypt is an innovative web-based tool that demonstrates how text and images can be converted into audio using an SSTV-style encryption concept. It is designed as a cybersecurity and steganography proof-of-concept, showing how ordinary data can be hidden inside sound waves for secure communication.

The project delivers a fast and smooth experience with a hacker-themed dark interface. Users can enter any text or upload an image and instantly convert it into a downloadable WAV file that represents the encrypted content in sound form. Decryption allows users to upload an encrypted WAV file to simulate extracting a message, showcasing the concept of audio-based data hiding.

SonicCrypt performs quickly and efficiently, generating audio files in seconds and providing real-time feedback to users. It combines creativity with cybersecurity and sound processing, making it an engaging project for learning encryption and data hiding concepts.

Future improvements can bring real SSTV encoding and decoding, image decryption, and advanced security features for practical applications.
