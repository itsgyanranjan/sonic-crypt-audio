SonicCrypt
SonicCrypt is an innovative, audio-based encryption and decryption system that transforms text and images into sound signals using a concept inspired by Slow-Scan Television (SSTV). This project is designed to showcase a unique approach to data security, blending cryptography with audio signal processing to create an original and creative encryption technique.

With SonicCrypt, users can encrypt text or image files into secure audio streams and later decrypt them back to their original form. It is not just a cybersecurity project but also a demonstration of experimental encryption methods that are visually and audibly engaging. The project features a dark, hacker-inspired interface with smooth functionality powered by a Flask backend for fast and responsive performance.
